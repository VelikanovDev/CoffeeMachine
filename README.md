# Coffee Machine
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy;

In this project I have realised coffee machine simulator that takes your input commands which simulates real buttons on coffee machine. You can buy a cup of coffee, look at remains of ingridients in the storage and fill it. Enjoy your coffee :)
